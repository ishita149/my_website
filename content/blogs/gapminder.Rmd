# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv("C:/Users/Ishita Gupta/Desktop/Applied statistics with R/applied-statistics/session4-workshop2/data/adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv")
life_expectancy <- read_csv("C:/Users/Ishita Gupta/Desktop/Applied statistics with R/applied-statistics/session4-workshop2/data/life_expectancy_years.csv")

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries
view(countries) 
view(hiv)
view(life_expectancy)
view(worldbank_data)
```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.
 
We clean up the data and then join them here.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
tidy_hiv <-hiv %>%
  pivot_longer(cols= 2:34, names_to = "year", values_to = "hiv_rate") #Creating a new column for year and hiv_rate using pivot

#%>%drop_na(hiv_rate)

tidy_lifeexpectancy <- life_expectancy %>%
  pivot_longer(cols= 2:302, names_to = "year", values_to = "life_expectancy_rate")  #Creating a new column for year and life_expectancy using pivot

#%>%drop_na(life_expectancy_rate)

tidy_worldbank<- worldbank_data %>% 
  rename(
    year = date,
    GDP_per_capita=NY.GDP.PCAP.KD,
    primary_school_enrollment=SE.PRM.NENR,
    mortality_rate=SH.DYN.MORT,
    fertility_rate=SP.DYN.TFRT.IN
    ) %>% #renaming columns to simpler names
  mutate(year=as.character(year) ) #converting numeric column to character


join1<- full_join(tidy_hiv, tidy_lifeexpectancy, by = c('country','year')) #joining hiv and life_expectancy
join2<- full_join(join1, tidy_worldbank, by = c('country','year')) #joining the above with worldbank data
join2
main_table<- left_join(join2, countries, by = 'country') #joining above with countries table
main_table #final table for hiv,life_expectancy,worldbank and countries
```
We are using a full outer join for hiv, life expectancy and worldbank data since each of the three may have NA in some places but we want all of the data for analysis.
We do a left join of the above three with countries because we want the country data corresponding to each entry for the above parameters.

Relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy

```{r, echo=TRUE}
main_table_na<- main_table %>% 
  drop_na()

main_table_na

plot1<-ggplot(main_table_na, aes(x=hiv_rate, y=life_expectancy_rate)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1) +
  #geom_smooth(method=lm)
  facet_wrap(~ region,scales="free") +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "How does HIV prevalence affect our age?", # add labels to the df
       subtitle = "Split by region",
       caption = "Source: https://www.gapminder.org/data" # Source
       ) +
  
  xlab("People with HIV per 100 for ages 15-49") + # x-axis
  ylab("Life expectancy")

plot1
```

From the graphs above, we can infer that the data is right skewed which means that having lower HIV prevalence generally has a higher life expectancy. This is particularly true for the Asian and American countries, however in the African countries we see the higher HIV prevalence and a lower life expectancy.

1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful

```{r, echo=TRUE}
grouping_table<-main_table%>% 
  drop_na(c('GDP_per_capita','fertility_rate'))%>%
  group_by(region,year) %>%
  summarize(mean_GDP=mean(GDP_per_capita),mean_fertility_rate=mean(fertility_rate))
grouping_table
 plot2<- ggplot(grouping_table, aes(x=mean_fertility_rate, y=mean_GDP)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  #geom_smooth(method=lm)
 facet_wrap(~ region, scales='free') +
   theme_bw()+
 labs(title = "Fertility rate and GDP, are the related?", # add labels to the df
       subtitle = "Split by region",
       caption = "Source: https://www.gapminder.org/data" # Source
       ) +
  
  xlab("Mean births per woman") + # x-axis
  ylab("Mean GDP")


plot2
```
We see that there is an almost linear relation between fertility rate and GDP for most regions except 'Middle East and North Africa'. We also see a steep trend in regions with more developing countries like in the case of 'South Asia' and 'Latin America'.


How has the Mortality rate changed by region?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot_mortality<-main_table %>%
  drop_na(mortality_rate) %>%
  group_by(region,year)%>%
  summarize(mean_mortality_rate=mean(mortality_rate))
plot_mortality

plot3<- ggplot(plot_mortality, aes(x=year, y=mean_mortality_rate, group=region)) + 
  geom_line(xaxt='n')+
  facet_wrap(~region,scales='free')+ 
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank())+
#splitting by region
  #Adding labels
  labs(title = "How has mortality rate changed over the years?",
       caption = "Source: https://www.gapminder.org/data") +
  xlab("Years") +
  ylab("mortality rate (per 1000 live births)")
  #geom_smooth(method=lm)
#+facet_wrap(~ income_level)

plot3

```
Which countries had the most and least improvement in mortality rate? 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mortality_rate_filtered<-main_table %>%
select(c(country,region,year,mortality_rate)) %>% #selecting relevant columns
  pivot_wider(names_from=year,values_from=mortality_rate)%>% #adding pivot to convert to columns
  rename(year1='1979',
         year2='2011') %>% #renaming the columns
  mutate(change=((year2-year1)/year1)*-100)%>% #finding change percentage
  select(c(country,change,region))%>%
  drop_na(change)%>% #dropping values with NA
  arrange(desc(change)) #arranging in descending

best_5<- mortality_rate_filtered %>% top_n(n=-5,wt=change) #identifying best 5 countries 
worst_5<-mortality_rate_filtered %>% 
  top_n(n=5,wt=change) #identifying worst 5 countries 
  
best_5
worst_5
```
We see that Asian countries have had the major change in mortality rate and Subsaharan African countries have the least change in mortality rates.

Relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate

```{r, echo=TRUE}

plot4<- ggplot(main_table, aes(x=fertility_rate, y=primary_school_enrollment,colour=region)) +  #defining the x and y axis
  geom_point()+ #plotting the scatter plot
geom_smooth()+ #adding the trend line
  #Adding labels
  labs(title = "How are primary school enrollment and fertility rate correlated?",
       caption = "Source: https://www.gapminder.org/data") +
  xlab("Births per woman") +
  ylab("% enrollment in primary school")


plot4
```
We see that as the fertility rate is increasing, the primary school enrollment decreases. This is prevalent in a lot of African countries like Afganistan. However we also see a lot of outliers like in case of Middle Eastern contries where the fertility rate is more however the primary school enrollment is towards the higher end as well. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
corrmat<-main_table %>%
  drop_na(mortality_rate,fertility_rate,life_expectancy_rate,primary_school_enrollment,hiv_rate) %>%
  select(mortality_rate,fertility_rate,life_expectancy_rate,primary_school_enrollment,hiv_rate)
  
cormat <- round(cor(corrmat),2)
head(cormat)

library(reshape2)
melted_cormat <- melt(cormat)
head(melted_cormat)
ggplot(data = melted_cormat, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + 
  geom_tile()
```
