# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Save data set in variable "movies"
movies <- read.csv("C:/Users/Ishita Gupta/Desktop/Applied statistics with R/applied-statistics/session2-workshop1/data/movies.csv")

# Take a look at the data frame
glimpse(movies)

```

## Data Cleaning:

- We will take a look at `NA` and duplicated values:

```{r duplicates_NA, echo=TRUE}
# Sum of duplicates
duplicates <-sum(any(duplicated(movies)))
# Sum of NA values
na_values <- sum(any(is.na(movies)))

# Check for NA values in the data frame. If return is FALSE, then the sum should yield 0.
print(paste0("Total NA in movies data set: ", na_values), quote=FALSE)

# Check for duplicate values. If return is FALSE, then the sum should yield 0.
print(paste0("Total duplicates in movies data set: ", duplicates), quote=FALSE)
```
Both answers are `FALSE`. The sum of both outcomes yields `0`. Therefore there no `NA` nor `duplicate` values.

Are we sure about this? Let's analyse it in further detail!

```{r duplicates_NA_2, echo=TRUE}
skim(movies) # Data Summary
```
If we take a look at the titles, it says **"unique" = 2907**. However, there are **2961 rows**. There is a discrepancy of about **54** movie titles. *But why is that?*

```{r analyse_duplicates, echo=TRUE}
an_dup<- movies %>%
  filter(duplicated(movies$title)) # Filter by duplicated in column title

```
Indeed, these 54 titles are repeated. However the result did not come up with `duplicated()`. We will take a few examples and analyse why. One hypothesis would be that at least 1 column is slightly different.

```{r duplicate_examples, echo=TRUE}

dup_sample<-movies %>%
  filter(title %in% c("Spider-Man 3", "Alice in Wonderland", "Cinderella", "Twilight"))

# Show first 10 results
kable(head(dup_sample, 10))
```
**Aha!** As it seems, there happens to be a discrepancy with the votes. These duplicated records have a different number of votes.

Since the difference is not significant, we will proceed to eliminate these duplicates based on the movie title and continue our analysis that way.

```{r movies_cleaned, echo=TRUE}

movies <- movies %>%
  filter(!duplicated(movies$title)) # filter by not duplicated on column title

movies
skim(movies)


```
Our data set is now good to go: 2907 unique titles, 2907 rows.


## Analysis

### Movies and Genre

Let's produce a table with the rank of movies by genre

```{r movies_by_genre, echo=TRUE}

movies_by_genre <- movies %>%  # Save in object 'movies_by_gender'
  group_by(genre) %>% # Group by genre
  summarise(count = n()) %>% # Create column counting values
  arrange(desc(count)) # Arrange by descending order

kable(movies_by_genre)
```

### Gross Profit and Budget

We will now analyse the gross profit and budget.

Let's produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre and analyse the `return_on_budget` to see how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. We will show the first 10 results so as to take a look at the data set.

```{r rob_movies, echo=TRUE}
rob_movies <- movies %>%  # Save in object "rob_movies" - rob = return on budget
  mutate(return_on_budget = (gross/budget)) # Calculate how much did a movie make at the box office for each $ of is budget

# Show first 10 results
kable(head(rob_movies, 10))

```
The data set now has a column at the end with the return on budget. Useful as this might be, it's not very neat to look at this from the movie level. We will group this by genre and analyse results. We will display the `$` in Millions of dollars.

```{r avg_gross_and_budget_table, echo=TRUE}


rob_by_genre <- rob_movies %>% # Save into new object
  group_by(genre) %>% # group by genre - rows will collapse
  summarise(gross_mean = mean(gross), budget_mean = mean(budget), return_on_budget = mean(return_on_budget)) %>% # Calculate average of gross and budget
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget)) # arrange in descending order

# Since the view of this tab is not very neat, we will proceed to transform the values in "gross_mean" and "budget_mean" into Millions.

rob_by_genre_in_M <- rob_by_genre %>%
  mutate(gross_mean = format(round(gross_mean / 1e6, 1), trim = TRUE), # Convert into millions
         budget_mean = format(round(budget_mean / 1e6, 1), trim = TRUE)) # Convert into millions

# Show results in Millions
kable(rob_by_genre_in_M)

```
### Are directors profitable enough?

To find out, let's produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. 

We will add summary statistics as well to make it look more interesting.

```{r top_15_directors_table, echo=TRUE}

top_15_directors <- movies %>% # save in object
  group_by(director) %>% # group by directors - rows will collapse
  
  # Calculate total, mean, median gross and sd
  summarise(total = sum(gross),
            mean = mean(gross),
            median = median(gross),
            sd = sd(gross)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% # arrange in descending order
  top_n(n=15, wt=total) # show top 15 values


# Convert results into Millions

top_15_in_M <- top_15_directors %>%
  mutate(total = format(round(total / 1e6, 1), trim = TRUE), # Convert into millions and so on
         mean = format(round(mean / 1e6, 1), trim = TRUE),
         median = format(round(median / 1e6, 1), trim = TRUE),
         sd = format(round(sd / 1e6, 1), trim = TRUE))

# Result represented in Millions
kable(top_15_in_M)

```
### Ratings by genre

We will produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre and add a page describing the dataset.
```{r genre_distribution, echo=TRUE}
# Create data frame with genre as categorical variable and the mean, min, max, median and SD as numerical variables.
# We use the first data frame with results in their original format

genre_distribution <- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  
  # Calculate mean, min, max median and sd
  summarise(rating_mean = mean(rating),
            rating_min = min(rating),
            rating_max = max(rating),
            rating_median = median(rating),
            rating_sd = sd(rating))

# Print table with histograms
skim(genre_distribution)

```



## Plotting results

### Facebook Likes and Gross Profit
**Can facebook users predict the gross profit of movies?**

We will produce a scatterplot analysing the number of `cast_facebook_likes` received and the `gross_profit` generated. *Is there a positive correlation between these?*
  

```{r gross_fblikes, echo=TRUE}

gross_fblikes <- ggplot(movies, aes(x = cast_facebook_likes,
                   y = gross,
                   colour = genre)) +
  
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(col = 'black') + #create a line
  scale_x_log10() +  # Use the log scale since data is crowded along the X axis
  scale_y_log10() +  # Use the log scale since data is crowded along the Y axis
  
  # Add labels
  labs(title = "Relationship between gross profit and cast facebook likes",
       color = "Genre",
       caption = 'Source: Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset') +
  xlab("The number of facebook likes cast members received") +
  ylab("The gross earnings in the US box office")


plot(gross_fblikes)
```
X axis should be the number of `cast_facebook_likes` and Y axis should be the `gross_profit`.

The data suggests a positive correlation between `gross profits` and number of `facebook likes`. The problem is that the data **very centered** around the middle (specific range of likes). This does not allow us to draw any certain conclusions because data on the edges seem to be insufficient.


### Budget and Gross Profit

Let's delve further into this. We will now analyse the relationship between `gross` and `budget` producing a scatterplot.

```{r, gross_on_budget, echo=TRUE}

gross_on_budget <- ggplot(movies, aes(x = budget,
                   y = gross,
                   color = genre)) +
  
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +

  scale_x_log10() +  #Use the log scale since data is crowded along the X axis
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_quantile(quantiles = 0.5) +
  
  # Add labels
  labs(title = "Relationship between gross profit and budget of the movies",
       caption = 'Source: Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset') +
  xlab("Budget of the movies") +
  ylab("The gross earnings in the US box office")


plot(gross_on_budget)

```
  
It can be appreciated that there is a positive correlation between the `budget` invested in movies and the `gross profits` in the US box office. Most points concentrate on the top right of the plot, thereby establishing a positive correlation. This is to be expected in most cases - **otherwise film business would have ended years ago.**

There can also be interesting `outliers` that generate a lot of profits with not much budget.

### iMDB Ratings and Gross Profit

We will examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Let's produce a scatterplot faceted by `genre`.
```{r gross_on_rating, echo=TRUE}
gross_on_rating <- ggplot(movies, aes(rating,
                   gross,
                   color = rating)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8)  +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between gross profit and iMDB rating",
       caption = 'Source: Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset') +
  xlab("iMDB Rating") +
  ylab("Gross profit") +
  facet_wrap(~genre)

plot(gross_on_rating)
```

For `action`, `adventure` and `comedy` categories there is a very large concentration of points in the upper right corner, indicating that there may be a positive interdependence between high ratings and gross profit. We may not see a very clear trend for other categories: even though `drama` and `crime` have high ratings, the `gross profit` line is vertical, so some very high-rated movies resulted in low level of profits. Conversely, `Horror` and `Fantasy` movies brought very high profits for most of the movies rated positively.

However, in other genres such as `family`, `musical`, `romance`, `Sci-Fi`, `thriller` and `western`, there is a scarcity of data that does not allow us to come to insightful conclusions. There is no indicator that these sort of genres will generate less revenue than those genres for which the data is abundant.
